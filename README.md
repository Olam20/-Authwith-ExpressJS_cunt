# Is “Delete User Functionality After Authentication” a Good Idea?

No, it’s not enough.

Let's break this down 

## Authentication

Authentication is like showing your ID at the door to prove who you are. You’re authenticating yourself when you log into a system with a username and password. The system now knows, “Okay, this is John Doe.”

But just because you’ve shown your ID doesn’t mean you should be able to do whatever you want once inside. Authentication only verifies who you are, not what you’re allowed to do.

## Authorization

This is where authorization comes in. Authorization is like the rules or permissions that say, “John Doe can access these files, but he can’t delete them.” The process determines what actions you’re allowed to perform based on your role or permissions within the system.

Even after you’re authenticated (logged in), the system needs to check what you’re authorized to do. For example, just because you can log in doesn’t mean you should be able to delete another user’s profile—unless you have specific authorization (like being an admin).

## Why Authentication Isn’t Enough

If you only require authentication before allowing someone to delete a profile, you’re missing a crucial step. Any user who can log in would then have the power to delete profiles, which could lead to accidental or malicious deletions.

Imagine a user who’s not supposed to have high-level privileges logs in and accidentally deletes another user’s profile. Without authorization checks, the system wouldn’t stop this from happening and would cause big problems.

## Why You Need Both

To protect your system’s integrity and security, you need both authentication and authorization. After a user logs in (authentication), the system should check their permissions (authorization) before allowing them to delete a profile.

So only users who are supposed to be able to delete profiles (like admins or users with specific roles) can actually do so. It’s not enough to know who the user is; you also need to know what they’re allowed to do.

## Real World Example

Think of it like entering a secure building. Authentication is the security guard at the front desk who checks your ID to make sure you belong there. Authorization is the keycard that lets you into specific rooms within the building. Just because you’ve been let into the building (authenticated) doesn’t mean you can enter every room—your keycard (authorization) determines which rooms you can access.

Similarly, in your system, just logging in doesn’t mean you should have access to every function. The system needs to check your permissions before you can perform actions like delete a user profile.

## Bottom Line

Don’t just use authentication to control who can delete profiles. It doesn’t do the security checks. Authentication knows who you are, authorization knows what you can do.
